    \bf ABSTRACT
\end{center}
Recent developments in reinforcement learning demonstrate that it can be applied in a variety of domains, including card games. In this thesis, we present a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the Italian card game of Briscola in a one-on-one setting. By utilizing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and training a deep neural network to learn the game's policy, our agent achieves performance comparable to that of an average human player with less than 20 minutes of training time. We further investigate the impact of various reward structures on the agent's learning process and identify potential areas of further improvement. To showcase the effectiveness of our agent, we provide a web-based version of the game where users can play against the trained agent, which can be accessed at \url{https://replit.com/@LorenzoCavuoti/BriscolaBot}. The code for the agent and the web-based game can be found in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/LetteraUnica/BriscolaBot}.
