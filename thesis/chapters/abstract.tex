    \bf ABSTRACT
\end{center}
Recent developments in reinforcement learning demonstrate that it can be applied in a variety of domains, including card games. In this thesis, we introduce BriscolaBot, a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the Italian card game of Briscola in a one-on-one setting. Using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm we train a deep neural network to approximate the optimal game policy. To our knowledge, our study marks the first attempt to evaluate the performance of a reinforcement learning agent in the game of Briscola against human players. In particular, our latest agent, BriscolaBot-v3, was able to achieve a 59\% win rate against average human players and 52\% against expert players. To showcase the effectiveness of our agent, we provide a web-based version of the game where users can play against BriscolaBot-v3, which can be accessed at \url{https://replit.com/@LorenzoCavuoti/BriscolaBot}. The code for the agent and the web-based game can be found in the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/LetteraUnica/BriscolaBot}.
